\def\myacknowledgements{I would like to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It
is His grace alone that has sustained me throughout the completion of this degree
despite life's twists and turns.

I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Furukawa, for his guidance and mentorship
throughout my graduate career. His constant feedback has allowed me to mature not
only as a researcher, but as a person. I would also like to thank my committee,
Dr. Kochersberger and Dr. Lattimer, for their time, counsel, and support.

I want to thank my corporate sponsors who helped to make this work possible. I would
like to thank Matt Stremler, Tim Ward, and Eric Holterman at the Commonwealth Center
of Advanced Manufacturing (CCAM) for their direction and support of this project.

I would like to thank members of every robotic lab on campus; without their depth
of knowledge, guidance, and support of this project, it would not have been
completed satisfactorily. In particular, I would like to thank Jason Ziglar, John
Seminator, Jack Newton, and Matt Meeder of the Mechatronics lab; John Peterson,
Evan Smith, and Danny Whitehurst of the Unmanned Systems Lab; Robert
Griffin of the Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls (TREC) Lab, and Adam
Shoemaker of the Center for Dynamic Systems Modeling and Control (DySMaC). In addition,
I would like to thank all my colleagues in the Computational Multi-physics Systems
(CMS) Lab and the Mitchell Robotics Lab (MRL). Without their help, input, and the
long nights, I would not have finished. Specifically, I would like to thank Kuya
Takami, Boren Li, Rich Fedora, Orson Lin, Murat Ambarkutuk, Luan Doan, Hangxin Liu,
Yazhe Hu, Tian Yi, Peter Amico, Cameron Ridgewell, Spencer Leamy, Jason Doyle,
Urvi Desai, Jihong Cai, Mickey Cowden, Tom Ehrenzeller, Diya Li, George Kontoudis,
Josiah Steckenrider, and Cong Chen, as well as Yoonchang Sung and Mengyu Song.

I would like to thank my twin brother, Steven, parents, Ken and Luany, as well as
all of my extended family, for their love, encouragement, continued moral support,
and advice on every difficult life decision. I would also like to thank all of
my friends, some of whom are as close as family, for all of the support and encouragement
they have given to me along the way. I would not be the person I am today without
their love, support, and direction throughout my life.

Finally, I would like to thank Virginia Tech, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets,
Air Force Detachment 875, and Denbigh Baptist Christian School. It was through your
positive learning environment that I was able to grow as both a student and a person.
