\def\myabstract{This paper will show the general framework necessary in order to solve two main problems preventing the development and widespread adoption of automation and robotics in construction (ARC). These problems include the fact that typical construction sites tend to be unstructured and are continuously evolving versus the highly controlled environments found in manufacturing. Also, the relationship between the part and manipulator has been reversed, causing increased complexity not seen in manufacturing environments where the part arrives at a fixed manipulator. The techniques that will be presented allow systems to create a 2-D map of their environment, localize themselves and complete the task(s) assigned. After localizing an augmented reality (AR) tag at the work site, the system is able to use a priori knowledge to localize points of interest (POIs) and complete several different types of operations achieving an accuracy of approximately $\pm$ 2 mm based on a multifaceted computer vision approach with only a USB webcam.}
