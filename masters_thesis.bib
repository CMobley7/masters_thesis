@inproceedings{Gerkey2008,
abstract = {— We consider the problem of autonomous naviga-tion in an unstructured outdoor environment. We describe the planning and control aspects of an implemented system that drives a robot at modest speeds (∼1 m/s) over a variety of outdoor terrain. In real time, we use a gradient technique to plan globally optimal paths on a cost map, then employ a predictive dynamic controller to compute local velocity commands. Our planner and controller are considered the " best in class " among 10 teams competing in the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robotics (LAGR) program.},

@inproceedings{Santos2013,
abstract = {— In this work, a study of several laser-based 2D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques available in Robot Operating System (ROS) is conducted. All the approaches have been evaluated and compared in 2D simulations and real world experiments. In order to draw conclusions on the performance of the tested techniques, the experimental results were collected under the same conditions and a generalized performance metric based on the k-nearest neighbors concept was applied. Moreover, the CPU load of each technique is examined. This work provides insight on the weaknesses and strengths of each solution. Such analysis is fundamental to decide which solution to adopt according to the properties of the intended final application.},

@inproceedings{Quigley2009,
abstract = {— This paper gives an overview of ROS, an open-source robot operating system. ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling; rather, it provides a structured communications layer above the host operating systems of a heterogenous compute cluster. In this paper, we discuss how ROS relates to existing robot software frameworks, and briefly overview some of the available application software which uses ROS.},
