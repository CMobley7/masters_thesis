abstract = {— We consider the problem of autonomous naviga-tion in an unstructured outdoor environment. We describe the planning and control aspects of an implemented system that drives a robot at modest speeds (∼1 m/s) over a variety of outdoor terrain. In real time, we use a gradient technique to plan globally optimal paths on a cost map, then employ a predictive dynamic controller to compute local velocity commands. Our planner and controller are considered the " best in class " among 10 teams competing in the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robotics (LAGR) program.},

@phdthesis{Burton2015,
abstract = {(ABSTRACT) As robotic systems grow in complexity, they inevitably undergo a process of specialization whereby they separate into an array of interconnected subsystems and individual processes. In order to function as a unified system, these processes rely heavily on interprocess com-munications (IPC) to transfer information between subsystems and various execution loops. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and validation of the Valor ROS Controller, a hybrid IPC interface layer and robot controller. The Valor ROS Controller connects the motion control system, implemented with the internally created Bifrost IPC, developed by Team VALOR for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) with the high level software de-veloped by Team ViGIR that uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) IPC framework. The Valor ROS Controller also acts as a robot controller designed to run on THOR and ES-CHER, and is configurable to use different control modes and controller implementations. By combining an IPC interface layer with controllers, the Valor ROS Controller enabled Team VALOR to use Team ViGIR's software capabilities at the DRC Finals. In addition to the qualitative validation of Team VALOR competing at the DRC Finals, this thesis studies the efficiency of the Valor ROS Controller by quantifying its computational resourceful utilization, message pathway latency, and joint controller tracking. Another con-tribution of this thesis is the quantification of end-effector pose error incurred by whole-body motions. This phenomenon has been observed on both THOR and ESCHER as one of their arms moves through a trajectory, however, it has never been studied in depth on either robot. The results demonstrate that the Valor ROS Controller adequately uses computational re-sources and has message latencies in the order of 50 ms. The results also indicate several avenues to improve arm tracking in Team VALOR's system. Whole-body motions account for approximately 5 cm of the end-effector pose error observed on hardware when an arm is at near full extension.},

@inproceedings{Santos2013,
abstract = {— In this work, a study of several laser-based 2D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques available in Robot Operating System (ROS) is conducted. All the approaches have been evaluated and compared in 2D simulations and real world experiments. In order to draw conclusions on the performance of the tested techniques, the experimental results were collected under the same conditions and a generalized performance metric based on the k-nearest neighbors concept was applied. Moreover, the CPU load of each technique is examined. This work provides insight on the weaknesses and strengths of each solution. Such analysis is fundamental to decide which solution to adopt according to the properties of the intended final application.},

@inproceedings{Quigley2009,
abstract = {— This paper gives an overview of ROS, an open-source robot operating system. ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling; rather, it provides a structured communications layer above the host operating systems of a heterogenous compute cluster. In this paper, we discuss how ROS relates to existing robot software frameworks, and briefly overview some of the available application software which uses ROS.},
