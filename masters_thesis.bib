abstract = {This paper investigates the application potential for the technology-push manufacturing technology (TPMT) autonomous industrial mobile manipulation (AIMM), in order to link the conceptual ideas (academia) to actual manufacturing requirements (industry). The approach is based on the proposed TPMT methodology in a comprehensive industrial case study. More than 566 manufacturing tasks have been analyzed according to three main application areas (logistics, assistance, and service) to find their suitability for the AIMM technology. The conducted TPMT analysis shows that AIMM has great potential within the manufacturing industries. More than two thirds of the analyzed manufacturing tasks are solvable with AIMM within the next few years. The AIMM technology, at its current stage, finds most suitable applications within logistics (e.g., transportation and part feeding), moving toward assistance (e.g., (pre)assembly and machine tending), and in the future more service-minded tasks (e.g., maintenance and cleaning). Based on the identified real-world applications, it is possible to raise the AIMM technology to the next levels of industrial maturation, integration, and commercialization.},

Software that performs sensor fusion should therefore support the inclusion of a wide array of heterogeneous sensors. This paper presents a software package, robot{\_}localization, for the robot operating system (ROS). The package currently contains an implementation of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It can support an unlimited number of inputs frommultiple sensor types, and allows users to customize which sensor data fields are fused with the current state estimate.

abstract = {This article investigates the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) from the perspective of linear estimation theory. The problem is ﬁrst formulated in terms of graph embedding: a graph describing robot poses at subsequent instants of time needs be embedded in a three-dimensional space, assuring that the estimated conﬁguration maximizes measurement likelihood. Combining tools belonging to linear estimation and graph theory, a closed-form approximation to the full SLAM problem is proposed, under the assumption that the relative position and the relative orientation measurements are independent. The approach needs no initial guess for optimization and is formally proven to admit solution under the SLAM setup. The resulting estimate can be used as an approximation of the actual nonlinear solution or can be further reﬁned by using it as an initial guess for nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, the experimental analysis demonstrates that such reﬁnement is often unnecessary, since the linear estimate is already accurate.},

Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations.

abstract = {Since the Lucas-Kanade algorithm was proposed in 1981 image alignment has become one of the most widely used techniques in computer vision. Applications range from optical flow and tracking to layered motion, mosaic construction, and face coding. Numerous algorithms have been proposed and a wide variety of extensions have been made to the original formulation. We present an overview of image alignment, describing most of the algorithms and their extensions in a consistent framework. We concentrate on the inverse compositional algorithm, an efficient algorithm that we recently proposed. We examine which of the extensions to Lucas-Kanade can be used with the inverse compositional algorithm without any significant loss of efficiency, and which cannot. In this paper, Part 1 in a series of papers, we cover the quantity approximated, the warp update rule, and the gradient descent approximation. In future papers, we will cover the choice of the error function, how to allow linear appearance variation, and how to impose priors on the parameters.},

abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of recipes, this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses; presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects; provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory; suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book; supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/. Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.},

abstract = {Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) have been introduced as an effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches},

However, what the AIMM brings not only bigger operational range, but also lower manipulation accuracy. Great challenges arise in the sensing, calibration and coordination problems. This paper proposes a solution for the coordination problems of an object handling task for AIMM with limited operational range sensors and manipulators. Different from the existing Image Based Visual Servo(IBVS) with single camera-in-hand configuration, a RGB-D camera with camera-to-hand configuration is utilized. The object is detected by matching the color feature on the target object and measured by calibrating and matching the depth image with the RGB image. The hand-eye calibration between the sensor and the manipulator is performed using the specifically chosen object locations which lie in both the range of the two devices. Furthermore, instead of steering the mobile base along a preplanned trajectory, a position based visual servo controller is designed to guide the robot towards the object. The methods are implemented using an AIMM and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed coordination and control algorithm.},

abstract = {Digital control of color television monitors—in particular, via frame buffers—has added precise control of a large subset of human colorspace to the capabilities of computer graphics. This subset is the gamut of colors spanned by the red, green, and blue (RGB) electron guns exciting their respective phosphors. It is called the RGB monitor gamut. Full-blown color theory is a quite complex subject involving physics, psychology, and physiology, but restriction to the RGB monitor gamut simplifies matters substantially. It is linear, for example, and admits to familiar spatial representations. This paper presents a set of alternative models of the RGB monitor gamut based on the perceptual variables hue (H), saturation (S), and value (V) or brightness (L). Algorithms for transforming between these models are derived. Particular emphasis is placed on an RGB to HSV non-trigonometric pair of transforms which have been used successfully for about four years in frame buffer painting programs. These are fast, accurate, and adequate in many applications. Computationally more difficult transform pairs are sometimes necessary, however. Guidelines for choosing among the models are provided. Psychophysical corrections are described within the context of the definitions established by the NTSC (National Television Standards Committee).},

abstract = {Unlike robotics in the manufacturing industry, on-site construction robotics has to consider and address two unique challenges: 1) the rugged, evolving, and unstructured environment of typical work sites; and 2) the reversed spatial relationship between the product and the manipulator, i.e., the manipulator has to travel to and localize itself at the work face, rather than a partially complete product arriving at an anchored manipulator. The presented research designed and implemented algorithms that address these challenges and enable autonomous robotic assembly of freeform modular structures on construction sites. Building on the authors' previous work in computer-vision-based pose estimation, the designed algorithms enable a mobile robotic manipulator to: 1) autonomously identify and grasp prismatic building components (e.g., bricks, blocks) that are typically non-unique and arbitrarily stored on-site; and 2) assemble these components into pre-designed modular structures. The algorithms use a single camera and a visual marker-based metrology to rapidly establish local reference frames and to detect staged building components. Based on the design of the structure being assembled, the algorithms automatically determine the assembly sequence. Furthermore, if a 3D camera is mounted on the manipulator, 3D point clouds can be readily captured and registered into a same reference frame through our marker-based metrology and the manipulator's internal encoders, either after construction to facilitate as-built Building Information Model (BIM) generation, or during construction to document details of the progress. Implemented using a 7-axis KUKA KR100 robotic manipulator, the presented robotic system has successfully assembled various structures and created as-built 3D point cloud models autonomously, demonstrating the designed algorithms' effectiveness in autonomous on-site construction robotics applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general method for estimating the nominal relationship and expected error (covariance) between coordinate frames representing the relative locations of ob jects. The frames may be known only indirectly through a series of spatial relationships, each with its associated error, arising from diverse causes, including positioning errors, measurement errors, or tolerances in part dimensions. This estimation method can be used to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation. The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation) among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the relationships.},

abstract = {Pose graphs have become a popular representation for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. A pose graph is a set of robot poses connected by nonlinear constraints obtained from observations of features common to nearby poses. Optimizing large pose graphs has been a bottleneck for mobile robots, since the computation time of direct nonlinear optimization can grow cubically with the size of the graph. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for constructing and solving the linear subproblem, which is the bottleneck of these direct methods. We compare our method, called Sparse Pose Adjustment (SPA), with competing indirect methods, and show that it outperforms them in terms of convergence speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large set of indoor real-world maps, and a very large simulated dataset. Open-source implementations in C++, and the datasets, are publicly available.},

This problem is difficult because of the following paradox: to move precisely, a mobile robot must have an accurate environment map; however, to build an accurate map, the mobile robot's sensing locations must be known precisely. In this way, simultaneous map building and localization can be seen to present a question of `which came first, the chicken or the egg?' (The map or the motion?) When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning},

This paper critically examines the construction labor productivity macroeconomic data in the United States from 1979 to 1998 to determine their validity and reliability. Data collection, distribution, manipulation, analysis, and interpretation are reviewed and problems are identified. The paper also presents a comparison of construction and manufacturing labor productivity during this period. The main conclusion of the study is that the raw data used to calculate construction productivity values at the macroeconomic level and their further manipulation and interpretation present so many problems that the results should be deemed unreliable. The uncertainty generated in the process of computing these values is such that it cannot be determined if labor productivity has actually increased, decreased, or remained constant in the construction industry for the 1979-1998 period.},

abstract = {This article presents a unifying terminology for task-level programming of highly flexible mobile ma- nipulators in industrial environments. With a terminology of tasks and object-centered skills, industrial applications are analyzed in the logistic and assistive domains. The analysis shows that many tasks can actually be solved with a small library of predefined building blocks, called skills. In logistics domains, it can be exploited that the sequences of skills needed to solve specific tasks follow certain pat- terns, whereas in assistive tasks, the sequence vary a lot, and tasks must be taught to the robot by a user, based on Standard Operating Procedures or process knowledge. An overview is presented on how to implement a skill-based architecture, enabling reuse of skills for different industri- al applications, programmed by shop-floor workers. The terminology of tasks, skills, and motion primitives is intro- duced and designed to separate responsibilities of robot system developers, robot system integrators and shop floor users concerning programming of the robot system. The concept of testable pre- and postconditions assigned to the skills are proposed to help both in developing skills and asserting when a skill is applicable.},

abstract = {One of the challenges in developing real-world autonomous robots is the need for integrating and rigorously test- ing high-level scripting, motion planning, perception, and control algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce an open-source cross-platform software architecture called OpenRAVE, the Open Robotics and Animation Virtual Envi- ronment. OpenRAVE is targeted for real-world autonomous robot applications, and includes a seamless integration of 3-D simulation, visualization, planning, scripting and control. A plugin architecture allows users to easily write cus- tom controllers or extend functionality. With OpenRAVE plugins, any planning algorithm, robot controller, or sensing subsystem can be distributed and dynamically loaded at run-time, which frees developers from struggling with mono- lithic code-bases. Users of OpenRAVE can concentrate on the development of planning and scripting aspects of a problem without having to explicitly manage the details of robot kinematics and dynamics, collision detection, world updates, and robot control. The OpenRAVE architecture provides a flexible interface that can be used in conjunction with other popular robotics packages such as Player and ROS because it is focused on autonomous motion planning and high-level scripting rather than low-level control and message protocols. OpenRAVE also supports a powerful network scripting environment which makes it simple to control and monitor robots and change execution flow dur- ing run-time. One of the key advantages of open component architectures is that they enable the robotics research community to easily share and compare algorithms.},

abstract = {(ABSTRACT) As robotic systems grow in complexity, they inevitably undergo a process of specialization whereby they separate into an array of interconnected subsystems and individual processes. In order to function as a unified system, these processes rely heavily on interprocess com-munications (IPC) to transfer information between subsystems and various execution loops. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and validation of the Valor ROS Controller, a hybrid IPC interface layer and robot controller. The Valor ROS Controller connects the motion control system, implemented with the internally created Bifrost IPC, developed by Team VALOR for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) with the high level software de-veloped by Team ViGIR that uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) IPC framework. The Valor ROS Controller also acts as a robot controller designed to run on THOR and ES-CHER, and is configurable to use different control modes and controller implementations. By combining an IPC interface layer with controllers, the Valor ROS Controller enabled Team VALOR to use Team ViGIR's software capabilities at the DRC Finals. In addition to the qualitative validation of Team VALOR competing at the DRC Finals, this thesis studies the efficiency of the Valor ROS Controller by quantifying its computational resourceful utilization, message pathway latency, and joint controller tracking. Another con-tribution of this thesis is the quantification of end-effector pose error incurred by whole-body motions. This phenomenon has been observed on both THOR and ESCHER as one of their arms moves through a trajectory, however, it has never been studied in depth on either robot. The results demonstrate that the Valor ROS Controller adequately uses computational re-sources and has message latencies in the order of 50 ms. The results also indicate several avenues to improve arm tracking in Team VALOR's system. Whole-body motions account for approximately 5 cm of the end-effector pose error observed on hardware when an arm is at near full extension.},

In order to find a better IK solver for generic manipulator chains, a variety of open-source, drop-in alternatives have been implemented and evaluated for this paper. This article provides quantitative comparisons, using multiple humanoid platforms, between an improved implementation of the KDL inverse Jacobian algorithm, a set of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) IK algorithms that use a variety of quadratic error metrics, and a combined algorithm that concurrently runs the best performing SQP algorithm and the improved inverse Jacobian implementation. The best alternative IK implementation finds solutions much more often than KDL, is faster on average than KDL for typical manipulation chains, and (when desired) allows tolerances on each Cartesian dimension, further improving speed and convergence when an exact Cartesian pose is not possible and/or necessary.},

@article{Michalos2015,
abstract = {This paper investigates the flexibility aspects of production systems that use highly interactive and autonomous mobile robotic units. Open communication architectures and ontology technologies enable the accurate representation of robot capabilities. Mobile robots can relocate themselves and support the production process, thus providing a higher reconfiguration potential. Services are used for real time transactions between stationary and mobile robots towards the implementation of a process plan. The units can cooperate and determine their course of actions. This approach was applied to an experimental cell, where the system managed to implement production plans for the packaging of small sized products without human intervention.},

@article{Smith1990,
abstract = {In this paper, we describe a representation for spatial information, called the stochastic map, and associated procedures for building it, reading information from it, and revising it incrementally as new information is obtained. The map contains the estimates of relationships among objects in the map, and their un- certainties, given all the available information. The procedures provide a general solution to the problem of estimating uncertain relative spatial relationships. The estimates are probabilistic in nature, an advance over the previous, very conservative, worst-case approaches to the problem. Finally, the procedures are developed in the context of state-estimation and filtering theory, which provides a solid basis for numerous extensions.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study has been to evaluate the technology of autonomous mobile manipulation in a real world industrial manufacturing environment. The objective has been to obtain experience in the integration with existing equipment and determine key challenges in maturing the technology to a level of readiness suitable for industry. Despite much research within the topic of industrial mobile manipulation, the technology has not yet found its way to the industry. To mature the technology to a level of readiness suitable for industry real-world experience is crucial. This paper reports from such a real-world industrial experiment with two mobile manipulators. Design/methodology/approach – In the experiment, autonomous industrial mobile manipulators are integrated into the actual manufacturing environment of the pump manufacturer Grundfos. The two robots together solve the task of producing rotors; a task constituted by several sub-tasks ranging from logistics to complex assembly. With a total...},

abstract = {In this work a library for solving manipulator motion planning problems has been developed and an algorithm for imposing Cartesian constraint in single arm and dual arm operation has been proposed. The main algorithm is based on RRT [1]. The code has been tested with several single arm and dual arm robots. We have achieved to find collision free paths in environments occupied with obstacles. Example of such environments is the shelf from Amazon picking challenge. The implemented code also enabled us to perform complicated dual arm operations such as opening a hand wheel or opening a drawer.},

@article{Pedersen2016,
abstract = {Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.},
