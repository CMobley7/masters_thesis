abstract = {The actual research trends in robotics and automation in construction industry (RAC) are much different in comparison with the last decade. While during the 90s the R{\&}D activities were focused in the development of new robotic systems (most of them teleoperated) and in existing machinery automation, the actual efforts are concentrated more in the software integration, sensory data acquisition and processing, safety and secure systems, sensor-based process control and construction industrialization. This paper deals with the short state-of-the-art in the actual and features RAC research areas, including representative examples.},

@article{Feng2015,
abstract = {Unlike robotics in the manufacturing industry, on-site construction robotics has to consider and address two unique challenges: 1) the rugged, evolving, and unstructured environment of typical work sites; and 2) the reversed spatial relationship between the product and the manipulator, i.e., the manipulator has to travel to and localize itself at the work face, rather than a partially complete product arriving at an anchored manipulator. The presented research designed and implemented algorithms that address these challenges and enable autonomous robotic assembly of freeform modular structures on construction sites. Building on the authors' previous work in computer-vision-based pose estimation, the designed algorithms enable a mobile robotic manipulator to: 1) autonomously identify and grasp prismatic building components (e.g., bricks, blocks) that are typically non-unique and arbitrarily stored on-site; and 2) assemble these components into pre-designed modular structures. The algorithms use a single camera and a visual marker-based metrology to rapidly establish local reference frames and to detect staged building components. Based on the design of the structure being assembled, the algorithms automatically determine the assembly sequence. Furthermore, if a 3D camera is mounted on the manipulator, 3D point clouds can be readily captured and registered into a same reference frame through our marker-based metrology and the manipulator's internal encoders, either after construction to facilitate as-built Building Information Model (BIM) generation, or during construction to document details of the progress. Implemented using a 7-axis KUKA KR100 robotic manipulator, the presented robotic system has successfully assembled various structures and created as-built 3D point cloud models autonomously, demonstrating the designed algorithms' effectiveness in autonomous on-site construction robotics applications.},

@article{Alter1992,
abstract = {Model-based object recognition commonly involves using a minimal set of matched model and image points to compute the pose of the model in image coordinates. Furthermore, recognition systems often rely on the $\backslash$weak-perspective" imaging model in place of the perspective imaging model. This paper discusses computing the pose of a model from three corresponding points under weak-perspective projection. A new solution to the problem is proposed which, like previous solutions, involves solving a biquadratic equation. Here the biquadratic is motivated geometrically and its solutions, comprised of an actual and a false solution, are interpreted graphically. The equations take a new form, which lead to a simple expression for the image position of any unmatched model point. c Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1992) Acknowledgments:},

@article{Rojas2003,
abstract = {Messrs. Rojas and Aramvareekul (2003) should be commended for a careful reexamination of the widely publicized decline in U.S. construction labor productivity. Declining productivity re-flects negatively on the image of the industry and has significant economic effects. Over time, declining productivity will result in some combination of declining real wages, increasing real con-struction costs, declining profits, or lower quality. Declining pro-ductivity implies that management and workers are performing worse and worse over time. In common with many others, Rojas and Aramvareekul mea-sure productivity as output (in constant dollars) per hour of work. In contrast, Allmon et al. (2000) measured productivity in terms of unit labor costs, output, and direct work rates at the individual work task level. They generally found increasing construction productivity in the past few decades, as measured by cost per unit of work and physical output per hour of work. Rojas and Aram-vareekul attempt to resolve this contradiction. In essence, the authors argue that the aggregate, national data available for estimating productivity changes are so poor that the trend of change cannot be reliably discerned. Goodrum et al. (2002) reach a similar conclusion. Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not report productivity trends in the construction industry, due to unreliable data. Rojas and Aramvareekul also argue that changes in the mix of construction activities may be responsible for any productivity decline. Rather than leave this important question unanswered, it may be useful to examine some additional information. As noted by the authors, the best source of output data for the construction industry comes from the Census of Construction In-dustries, which is used to produce the benchmark U.S. input-output tables every 5 years. Using the four benchmarks in the period 1982–1997 yields the productivity measurements shown here in Table 1. In essence, the benchmark output data suggests some improvement from 1982 to 1987 and essentially constant productivity thereafter. These results are generally consistent with those developed by the authors based on estimates of Construc-tion Value Put in Place; the productivity decline in their series comes prior to 1982. Changes in employee earnings will affect this productivity measure. In particular, reduction in input prices such as wages may lead to less output in dollar amounts, thereby reducing the productivity measure. (In contrast, output prices increasing at more than the rate of inflation would suggest increasing produc-tivity.) Real average wages have been declining in the construc-tion industry, as indicated in Table 1. Much of the productivity improvement measured in cost per unit of work and found by Allmon et al. (2000) came from declining wages. These average wage rate declines could arise from a variety of reasons, including substitution of lower skilled labor, change in the mix of construc-tion, reduction in union power, or others. Since labor wages are an appreciable portion of construction costs, Rojas and Aram-varekkul's productivity measure would ordinarily be expected to decline with lower wage rates. If a decline is not observed (as in Table 1), we would expect productivity improvements to be com-pensating for the effect of wage declines. Interestingly, a wage decline also occurred in the manufacturing industry from 1987 to 1992. Another indication of productivity trends in the construction industry is provided by movements of cost and price indexes over time. Table 2 shows the trend of several such indexes over the period 1970–1998 (Hendrickson 2003). Most construction in-dexes are based upon the cost of a bundle of material and re-source inputs into construction, such as the ENR building index.},
